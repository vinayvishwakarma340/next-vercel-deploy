      "content": "<p><em><strong>By Avanthika P</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>After the pandemic, bringing back the employees from the comfort zones of their homes to office is the next conundrum for the HR department. Though most of the organisations have introduced the hybrid work, the back to office ratio of employees is still below the mark and expectation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A report by Nasscom and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has found that just 5 per cent of tech staff are willing to return full time to workplaces. Another survey conducted by recruitment and staffing firm CIEL HR Services, found that at least 6 out of 10 employees were ready to resign instead of returning to the office.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Industry leaders coin this phenomenon as white collar lethargy and many CEOs consider this as the new pandemic! ETHRWorld interacted with industry leaders to know their take on white collar lethargy and understand whether they are liberal in terms of giving employee flexibility or not.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sumit Sabharwal, CEO, TeamLease HRTech, opines that it's pretty evident that organisations and HR departments have not been able to bring back employees back to office the way they would have liked. He expresses that the issue of white collar lethargy is forcing HR departments to consider new retention policies that allow to counter the attrition that mandatory working from office has resulted in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sabharwal believes that technology coupled with empathy is the right mix to deal with the issue at hand. \"I think organisations that have adopted technology for work from home models are doing fine. With remote working suites now an integral part of HRTech, we believe that employee engagement, monitoring and performance analysis can be carried out easily by not allowing lethargy to seep in,\" he says.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>TeamLease HRTech follows a hybrid model and the frequency to come to the office depends on the function of the work they do. If employees are required to come every day for better productivity, they can come. But, if they can work remotely, then their presence is mandatory for 2-3 days only.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Expectations of employees have changed significantly during the pandemic, and they are now looking for better work-life balance, personal wellbeing, benefits, welfare programmes, and growth, says Priya Cherian, Chief People Officer, PayU.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the post-pandemic world, employee flexibility is given ultimate preference by the employers. Though hybrid work appears to be the popular choice, the work model still depends on multiple variables, including job role, business function and work culture. In the upcoming times, when the legal scope of moonlighting is explored, the white collar preferences for remote work are expected to stay parallel to the onsite work.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The pandemic altered the workplace dynamics by giving new definitions for the work culture. Though remote work has gained more prominence after the pandemic, debates around the need for collaboration are still on. Nowadays, to improve the bonding between teammates and substitute the element of physical proximity, more organisations are going for the employee retreat.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Employee retreat is basically an off-site gathering where employees of a company gather at a third-party location to spend time together. It is a blend of exploring the official and unofficial aspects of work-life. The retreats usually consist of a combination of work discussion, training, personal bonding and relaxing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Benefits of employee retreat&nbsp;</strong><br />\"Now, as we return to office, I believe that employee retreats are among the best team-building exercises that a company can invest in. It facilitates a shift in the mindset from meeting over virtual calls, to bonding in a physical environment through engaging team activities,\" says M Lakshmanan, CHRO, L&amp;T Technology Services (LTTS).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\"When companies went remote, a lot of what we took for granted about being in office, changed &mdash; the idea of going beyond the office walls and breaking off from the cliched workflow. Retreats are a great opportunity for employees to be more candid about themselves, thus helping them to understand each other better,\" he adds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Reiterating on the under-appreciated benefits of employee retreats, Lakshmanan says, \"It is a wonderful way to reveal the underlying talents or hidden potential of team members. Once the retreat is over, your employees will get back to work energised, aligned to a common purpose and more empathetic to each other in the team.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Over the last few months, many organisations have gathered back again for company-wide or team-specific retreats and offsites, where employees physically engage in team-building activities and spend time together socially. It is imperative to bring in the concept of employee retreat to encourage building bonds, creating a feeling of belongingness, and fostering team-building amongst employees, says Akshay Raje, Head of People &amp; Culture, Scaler.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sharing a similar opinion, Raje of Scaler says while planning an employee retreat, the organisers should remember that topping the agenda with multiple things can overwhelm the employees. Planning competitive events or activities with too many physical and mental challenges may also take away the fun from a rejuvenating experience.</p>\r\n<p>Raje asserts that the only way for employee retreats to become successful is when there are clearly set boundaries allowing the employees to choose their level of decision-making without any judgements based on their comfort. Not every employee will be up for interaction or engagement with a large crowd. They may also have other commitments or family obligations they cannot get out of.</p>",

Some of them are already taking medications and the requirement of medication has gone up and the severity of symptoms has gone up,\" Dr Mudgal told IANS.</p>\r\n<p>According to her, there are a lot of people coming with fresh or recent onset symptoms of anxiety and adjustment issues pertaining to anxiety or mixed anxiety.</p>\r\n<p>Layoffs and loss of employment are very stressful experiences for most people. It is a time filled with uncertainties, economic challenges and loss of control over your future.</p>\r\n<p>According to Dr Rishi Gautam, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, The GW School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, DC, this can lead to significant impact on a professional's mental health and cause anxiety, depressed mood, shock and grief.</p>\r\n<p>\"It affects sleep and appetite, increases risk of unhealthy consumption of drugs and alcohol, causes worsened irritability, loss of self-esteem, family discord etc,\" Dr Gautam told IANS.</p>\r\n<p>Dr Arti Anand, a senior clinical psychologist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi, said that the pandemic and massive layoffs both knocked out the working class without any warning.</p>\r\n<p>\"This leads to fear and stress.

      "content": "<p>When Lyft laid off 13% of its workers in November, Kelly Chang was shocked to find herself among the 700 people who lost their jobs at the San Francisco company.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It seemed like tech companies had so much opportunity,&rdquo; said Chang, 26. &ldquo;If you got a job, you made it. It was a sustainable path.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Brian Pulliam, on the other hand, brushed off the news that crypto exchange Coinbase was eliminating his job. Ever since the 48-year-old engineer was laid off from his first job at the video game company Atari in 2003, he said that he has asked himself once a year, &ldquo;If I were laid off, what would I do?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The contrast between Chang&rsquo;s and Pulliam&rsquo;s reactions to their respective professional letdowns speaks to a generational divide that is becoming clearer as the tech industry, which expanded rapidly through the pandemic, swings toward mass layoffs.</p>\r\n<p>Millennials and Generation Z, born between 1981 and 2012, started tech careers during a decadelong expansion when jobs multiplied as fast as iPhone sales. The companies they joined were conquering the world and defying economic rules. And when they went to work at outfits that offered bus rides to the office and amenities including free food and laundry, they weren&rsquo;t just taking on a new job; they were taking on a lifestyle. Few of them had experienced widespread layoffs.</p>\r\n<p>Baby boomers and members of Generation X, born between 1946 and 1980, on the other hand, lived through the biggest contraction the industry has ever seen. The dot-com crash of the early 2000s eliminated more than 1 million jobs, emptying Silicon Valley&rsquo;s Highway 101 of commuters as many companies folded overnight.</p>\r\n<p>For Gen X, the dot-com collapse hit early in their careers. From 2001-05, the tech sector shed one-quarter of its workers, according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by CompTIA, a technology education and research organization.</p>\r\n<p>he layoffs that swept the industry were worse than the recession of the early 1990s, when total jobs in the tech sector fell by 5%, and the global financial crisis that followed in 2008, when the workforce contracted by 6%.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011, the tech sector began a hiring boom that would last a decade. It added an average of more than 100,000 jobs annually, and by 2021, it had recouped all the jobs it lost when the dot-com bubble burst.</p>\r\n<p>The job figures account for software, hardware, tech services and telecommunications companies, including Apple, Meta, Nvidia, Salesforce and others. But they may exclude some tech-related companies such as Airbnb, Lyft and Uber because of ambiguity in government labor market reporting that classifies some businesses as consumer services, said Tim Herbert, chief research officer at CompTIA.</p>",

      "content": "<p><em><strong>By Josh Boak | Associated Press Writer</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>America's employers added a solid 223,000 jobs in December, evidence that the economy remains healthy even as the Federal Reserve is rapidly raising interest rates to try to slow economic growth and the pace of hiring.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>With companies continuing to add jobs across the economy, the unemployment rate fell from 3.6% to 3.5%, matching a 53-year low, the Labor Department said Friday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All told, the December jobs report suggested that the labor market may be cooling in a way that could aid the Fed's fight against high inflation. Last month's gain was the smallest in two years, and it extended a hiring slowdown that began last year. And average hourly pay growth eased to its slowest pace in 16 months. That slowdown could reduce pressure on employers to raise prices to offset their higher labor costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Average wage growth was up 4.6% in December from 12 months earlier, compared with a recent peak of 5.6% in March. And in the past three months, job gains have averaged 247,000 - a decent pace but well below 2022's monthly average of 375,000.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\"If these trends continue, we can feel more and more confident that the strength of this labor market is sustainable,\" said Nick Bunker, head of economic research at the online job site Indeed's Hiring Lab. \"The outlook for next year is uncertain, but many signs point toward a soft landing,\" rather than a feared recession.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, December's hiring figures don't necessarily make the Fed's path forward any clearer. The pace of job gains is still strong enough to keep lowering the unemployment rate, which, in turn, could keep pay growth high. Lisa Cook, a member of the Fed's Board of Governors, said in a speech Friday that \"inflation is far too high\" and \"of great concern,\" though she also noted that wage growth \"has indeed started to decelerate.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Other recent data also point to a cooling economy: A measure of business activity in services, including finance, restaurants and transportation, contracted in December for the first time since 2020. A similar measure for manufacturing also shrank last month.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And a near-doubling of mortgage rates this year has sent home sales tumbling for 10 straight months.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Last month's job gains capped a second straight year of robust hiring during which the nation regained all 22 million jobs it lost to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet the rapid hiring and the hefty pay raises that accompanied it likely contributed to a spike in prices that catapulted inflation to its highest level in 40 years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The picture for 2023 is much cloudier. Many economists foresee a recession in the second half of the year, a consequence of the Fed's succession of sharp rate hikes. The central bank's officials have projected that those increases will cause the unemployment rate to reach 4.6% by year's end.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Among industries, the largest job gains last month were in health care, which added 74,00o. Leisure and hospitality, a category includes restaurants, hotels, and entertainment, gained nearly as much: 67,000.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Retailers added 9,000, transportation and warehousing companies nearly 5,000. Construction companies added 28,000 - a surprisingly large gain considering that higher borrowing rates are dragging down residential and commercial real estate.&nbsp;<br />Many of those jobs were part-time positions. That trend suggests that as inflation began to accelerate, some people took on second jobs to help keep up with rising costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Some companies, notably restaurants and hotels, are still scrambling to regain jobs lost to the pandemic. Among them is HMSHost, which operates 990 airport restaurants in North America under 35o different brands. The company is looking to hire loo workers to help staff new restaurants that will open in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Technology companies have been laying off workers for months, with some, including Amazon, saying that they had hired too many people during the pandemic. Amazon has boosted its layoffs to 18,000 from an earlier announcement of 10,000. Cloud software provider Salesforce says it will cut 10% of its workers. And Facebook's parent company Meta says it will shed 11,000.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Yet outside of high tech, smaller companies, in particular, are still hiring. According to the payroll processor ADP, companies with more than 500 employees cut jobs in December, while businesses below that threshold added many more workers. And an analysis by investment bank Jefferies showed that small companies were posting a historically high proportion of job openings.&nbsp;</p>",

In contrast, in recent years, many schools saw high hiring levels decline as the IT industry struggled with technology shifts and sluggish growth. IT firms are attempting to combat the problem of high attrition by maintaining a more extensive pipeline of freshers, whom they can employ, train, and deploy at a far cheaper cost than seasoned professionals or laterals.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amidst an unparalleled hiring boom, it also helps to increase retention. IT companies are taking deliberate measures to promote fresher recruiting to retain personnel, as the war for talent and resulting high attrition drive up wage costs. Campuses that had seen a fall in hiring in recent years following the surge at the start of the previous decade will find this to be a welcome change. Campus hiring was at an all-time high in the early 2010s. Companies were recruiting hundreds of students on campuses after a brief lull in employment after the global financial crisis in 2008, and this trend continued to an all-time high every year. The recruitment process for campus placements up until 2015&ndash;16 was completely different. Nearly 500 people would be hired by each company annually.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The epidemic has significantly expedited multinational organizations&rsquo; plans for digital transformation, resulting in the over-hiring of personnel with cutting-edge skills. With extensive and mid-sized IT services companies returning to double-digit revenue growth and multinational captives frantically growing their base in India, we are witnessing an unheard-of talent war. These two critical factors are fuelling the hiring momentum. One is that organizations are adopting digital to maintain company continuity, and not just because technology is driving this movement in business. In previous technological transitions brought on by mainframe, client-server, and the internet, prospects were mainly driven by one technology. Despite the market's acceleration driving up demand for laterals, CEOs' observations indicate that the balance is shifting in favour of new hires.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fresher students&rsquo; pay generally stayed the same despite rising demand; it still hovers around Rs 3.5 lakh on average. But given that it is a matter of supply and demand, the basic salaries offered by IT companies have mostly remained flat, and this is likely to stay the same, according to industry executives.</span></p>",

According to the data, such coasting has become widespread due to the pandemic. For example, a recent survey of 11,000 US workers revealed that 39% of them engaged in such behaviour. A study conducted in January 2022 by US analytics firm Gallup showed that 50% of workers said they were neither engaged nor disengaged at work. What do working parents want?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many circumstances, cost-conscious employees prefer to take advantage of the conveniences of being contemporary knowledge workers. Some people also opt to put other facets of their lives&mdash;like their families or well-being&mdash;before their careers. But is being lazy at work every day indeed an excellent long-term plan? Or could clock in and out while accomplishing the bare minimum have hidden costs?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The practice of \"coasting\" has always existed in the workplace. However, anecdotal data indicates that it has become more straightforward, popular, and attractive after 2020. Many in the workforce have also re-evaluated how their occupations fit into their personal lives. The pandemic has caused people to think about life, work, and family differently. Employees who are stressed out and overworked might coast while finishing their work more gradually. There is a limit to how much more you can give at work before people become fatigued. Therefore, coasting enables people to pause, recuperate, and then feel prepared to go again.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While coasting is frequently the result of deeper underlying problems at a firm, such as a missed promotion or the perception that their contributions aren't being sufficiently recognized, it can be simple to write it off as employee laziness. But performing the bare minimum at work, with no additional emotional or mental effort, might have a price. There may be more urgent dangers when coasting. A supervisor's observation of a consistently slack worker could have long-term effects, particularly for a young employee. The employer should collaborate with the employee to build a job and determine the proper roles and motivations.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding a better fit is preferable to remaining unfulfilled in a position.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coasting could be an appropriate short-term strategy for workers to refuel, take a break, and plan their next burst of energy. However, given the possible effects on the person's career and well-being, it could be more financially feasible over the long term.</span></p>",

Fuel costs are at an all-time high, transportation costs have gone up, and prices for food and other necessities are also increasing. So, a typical workday might be very expensive. But it seems unlikely that people will gladly return to covering office-day expenses the way they did before, given how aware they are now of how much office-day costs.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cost of accommodating an employee's employment outside the home, including travel to and from your workplace, might total tens of thousands of dollars annually. It is now possible to estimate how much money former commuters can save thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic's dramatic rise in work-from-home agreements. Work-from-home policies are advantageous to both employees and employers. The requirement for an office and all associated costs can be eliminated by using a fully remote crew. Businesses can cut prices even if they preserve their physical locations but adopt hybrid work arrangements. With this arrangement, a small business owner may save $11,000 per employee annually, claims Global Workplace Analytics. You may invest that money in your group.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees who have the option of working from home are understandably hesitant to commute to the office until necessary due to these escalating costs. Some businesses are aware of workers' worries and are presenting workable ways to reduce the costs associated with working days. But not all companies offer these benefits and stipends, so workers are forced to forgo remote work while incurring higher costs. Before the epidemic, most individuals accepted these expenditures without hesitation. Now that they've seen the alternative, \"going back to normal\" is not as easy as it once was, especially if other individuals receive more fantastic offers.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a significant impact on the women workforce as well. Many women will find that maintaining some degree of job flexibility would significantly improve their mental health and ability to combine their personal and professional lives; yet, this is more of a financial consideration for some. In many ways, the pandemic financially impacted women, leaving them with much less money to spend on a daily commute. However, many people have also made important life choices that will affect their finances, such as ending relationships or relocating to smaller towns or cities for a fresh start. As a result, the costs of a full-time office job for many people have drastically changed, as has the value they derive from working there.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There still needs to be a perfect answer to childcare costs when the workforce returns to the office. Working parents must handle childcare regardless of their job arrangement, whether remote, hybrid, or in-office. This is their top priority. Parents want such facilities to be provided at the workplace or to be part of their employees' salary packages. The level of desire for these benefits could be seen from the fact that in a survey in the US, 40% of the respondents were willing to look for a new job or leave the company if they didn&rsquo;t get them. On the flip side, what the companies should look at is that the same respondents are saying that they will be more productive, stick to the job, and be able to manage work-life balance, if they are assured that their children are being taken care of. This has the potential to drastically lower the dropout rate among working mothers. They are one of the most important abilities that have been lost as a result of the lack of such facilities.</span></p>",

      "content": "<p><em><strong>By Ashwini Deshpande</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Year 2022 saw the gradual dislodging of the Covid-19 pandemic from the No. 1 public health emergency spot, as the usual suspects (dengue, pollution and so on) regained their prime positions. On the health front, we seem to be heading back to business as usual, which simply means that we are back to battling old enemies, instead of dealing with the horrible new ogre that had engulfed us like a tsunami. But those who survived a severe infection of Covid-19 are battling its shad-ow: Long Covid.</p>\r\n<p>Is the economy, which got badly battered by the pandemic, also dealing with Long Covid? In this piece, I look at the long shadow of Covid on employment levels and women&rsquo;s work (paid and unpaid). Throughout the pandemic, the Centre for Economic Data and Analysis (CEDA) at Ashoka University has been providing real-time updates on the health of the economy based on the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE) data. Having been hit hard during the initial months of the Covid-19 pandemic, employment lev-els are recovering but have yet to re-tur n to pre-pandemic levels, Compared with January 2020, around 14 million fewer individuals &mdash; 4.5 million fewer men and 9.6 mil-lion fewer women &mdash; were employed in October 2022.</p>\r\n<p>During the Covid-induced lock-downs, in absolute terms more men lost employment than women, which reflects the pre-pandemic male-female gap in paid employment. However, in proportionate terms, women lost more in the first year of the pandemic. Women&rsquo;s participation in paid work gradually returned to pre-pandemic levels but with a fair bit of fluctuation.</p>\r\n<p>While urban employment (and hence manufacturing and services) took a hit, as businesses struggled to get back on their feet, employment in the agricultural sector increased, since agriculture provided refuge to returnee migrants and to the rural population at large. Accordingly, ur-ban women&rsquo;s employment suffered more than their rural counterparts. We should note that the increase in agricultural employment could re-flect distress work, rather than gainful employment.</p>\r\n<p>But the rise in agricultural employ-ment has slowed down in the past year: there was a 4% increase in em-ployment in agriculture from 2019-2020 to 2020-2021. This was followed by a smaller increase (2.6%) in 2021-2022. This has contributed to a de-cline in the rate of growth of overall rural employment.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Demographic Dividend?</strong><br />We hear repeated references to India&rsquo;s demographic dividend. It is true that we have a large and growing reservoir of labour power, but the increase in employment has not kept pace with the increase in the working-age population, when GDP has been growing at over 6% per annum on average. Unless the large and growing pool of poten-tial workers is productively employed, India cannot convert the demographic reality of a large pool of youth into a dividend. The jobless growth phenom-enon predates Covid, but the urgency of addressing this has become sharp-er in the shadow of the pandemic.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Gender Dividend</strong><br />India has another under-utilised divi-dend: the productive power of women. Livelihood activities of families &mdash; farms, livestock, orchards, kirana shops, handicrafts, food products and so on &mdash; run on the backs of unpaid, unrecognised, unrewarded labour of women. These are activities that generate income for the family, and men participating in these activities are counted as workers (or in the labour force) but not women.</p>\r\n<p>This is over and above the daily domestic chores (washing, cooking, cleaning, house maintenance) that is predominantly the responsibility of women. In India, women spend 10x the time that men spend on these activities. The expectation that taking care of the household is primarily the woman&rsquo;s job is the chief constraint on women&rsquo;s ability to take up jobs that involve commuting. Lack of safe and reliable transportation makes this constraint more binding.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Covid-19 and Women&rsquo;s Work</strong><br />In the first month of the lockdown, according to CMIE data, men stepped up and increased their share of domestic work. But by December 2021, the male-female gap in time spent on domestic work was greater than it was in December 2019. While work-from-home (WFH) became the norm for large sections of workers, informal workers whose nature of work, by definition, was outdoors (daily wagers, street vendors, facto-ry workers) did not have the luxury of WF. Several women have always been home-based workers doing very low productivity jobs for a pittance. That work is highly vulnerable to econom-ic vagaries: if Zara decides to reduce the production of shirts, women who stitch buttons on these shirts are out of work. For employment and women&rsquo;s work to emerge out of the long shadow of Covid-19, we need to focus attention on expanding rural non-farm em-ployment, especially labour-intensive manufacturing. To increase women&rsquo;s entry into paid work, there is an urgent need to improve trans-port and provide subsidised cooking fuel. Research has shown that these aid female labour force participation (FLFP). Both public sector and pri-vate employers need to pay attention to gender composition of their work-force at all levels: recruitment, retention, reentry.</p>\r\n<p>The lockdowns made families real-ise just how much work gets done at home every single day. This would be a good time to focus on shifting norms around domestic chores by adopting the 3 Rs: recognise, reduce, redistribute. This is only possible when women are in decision-making positions in both public and private spheres. Let us utilise Covid&rsquo;s long shadow to make this happen.</p>",

      "content": "<p><em><strong>By Professor Heather McGregor, Provost and Vice Principal of Heriot-Watt University Dubai</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>What would you do if you were told that the skillsets you possess today would become obsolete 10 years from now? And that the job you are doing would no longer exist? For most of us, it would mean taking a close look at our present capabilities, finding ways to augment them and adapting ourselves to a different sort of workplace so we still fit in. Whether you choose to augment your current skills (upskilling) or retrain in a totally different area (reskilling) you would be joining millions of people worldwide in getting ready for the future stages of your working life.</p>\r\n<p>Emergence of emotional labour<br />The skills of the future may be ill-defined, but we know that they will employ cognitive and emotional labour. Workers originally contributed physical labour to employers, which consisted of the ability to move and manipulate objects and depended largely on muscular strength and dexterity. In the last few decades, we have seen the growth of cognitive labour, founded on the bedrock of cognitive capacity, memory, which is manifested as the ability to memorise and recall knowledge and information. This progresses to include analysis of information, optimisation and decision making, critical thinking, and ultimately creativity. Finally, we are seeing the emergence of emotional labour which is the deployment of skills and capabilities such as awareness, self-motivation, empathy and relationship-building, all coupled with a sense of purpose and meaning, and behaving ethically.</p>\r\n<p>Demands of job market<br />The growth of cognitive and emotional labour, within a job market that is seeing the rise of some sectors and the shrinking of others, means that the demands of the job market are continually changing. In India, for example, the digital revolution that has taken place across all industrial sectors means that the jobs of today are radically different to those of just a few years ago, and the jobs of tomorrow will be different again. According to data analysed by Monster.com, the next five years will see half of the workforce in India needing to retrain and upskill.</p>\r\n<p>Upskilling benefits<br />There are several advantages to upskilling. For employees, developing new skills can help you stay relevant and improve employability &ndash; an example could be an e-commerce company training its developers in the use of AI that can be used to track consumer buying patterns. Other advantages of upskilling include the potential discovery of new passions and interests which could lead to new career possibilities. It could give you the chance to meet people, expand your professional network, and offer a fresh perspective. Reskilling can sometimes be a good way to re-enter the workforce after a very long break, or even to switch careers. Personally, I used the pandemic, when I was stuck at home and could not travel, to qualify as a management accountant; I expect this to be useful in the non-executive roles that I expect to hold in the future when my career in education eventually comes to an end.</p>\r\n<p>The advantages don&rsquo;t stop with just employees though. Equally, for employers, investing in upskilling or reskilling your employees can benefit you in several ways. Talent acquisition is time-consuming, and as an employer, it is far simpler to retain existing employees by upskilling them for a changing environment than it is to hire new talent. Another reason is driving employee satisfaction &ndash; some studies have shown that 91% of Gen Z employees (born 1990-1999) factor in professional training opportunities when choosing an employer. With upskilling, some employees may be able to step up and play more leadership-oriented roles.</p>\r\n<p>If you wish to take charge of your own development to stay employable, there are several ways to do this.</p>\r\n<p>Enhancing employability<br />The most common is to take on an additional project at work, something that is completely outside of your regular job. These stretch opportunities are a great way to learn more about a different line of work and are a very effective way to upskill (provided, of course, that you are not neglecting your main role). Another way is by allocating some time each week to follow industry leaders and experts. There is a rich repository of professional literature available online on LinkedIn, TED Talks, podcasts and more. Joining an industry or professional association could also help, as they often have workshops and discussions that can offer insights. Volunteering for a charity can help to gain experience that you may not get at work &ndash; charities and not-for-profits need much more than fundraising &ndash; you could be helping with finance, for example, or people, or operations.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, an additional degree or a specialist course can build on your current skills to boost your job role or position you as a knowledge leader in your existing industry. Several higher education institutes today have degrees that offer flexible study and are ideal for working professionals. At Heriot-Watt University Dubai for example, we have significant experience in delivering postgraduate education and many of our students are from India. We find they choose our courses for the flexibility and pace of study they offer, the accreditations, the world-class faculty who teach them and the work placements they get in the Middle East once they graduate. Our programmes allow them to focus on building a specific need or skillset &ndash; professionals can enrol in any of the vast numbers of subjects that we offer across our programmes whilst learning through real-life experiences and local as well as global best practices. UAE student visas also now permit employment.</p>\r\n<p>We offer all our students and all our staff members the chance to develop a statement describing their purpose, and the impact that they want to have on the world. That&rsquo;s a useful starting place if you don&rsquo;t know how to plan your future career or what skills to try and develop next. Purpose-led people &ndash; and companies &ndash; are shown to have greater resilience and flexibility, useful in today&rsquo;s ever-changing employment marketplace. Whatever the jobs of tomorrow look like.</p>",

      "content": "<p><em><strong>By Rajlakshmi Ghosh</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>To boost the research ecosystem, higher educational institutions (HEIs) are going all out to ensure their faculty members have adequate funding, internal resources and specialised equipment for research. The Banaras Hindu University (BHU), for instance, has launched a Research Promotion Scheme in which faculty members who receive projects from external agencies are likely to benefit.</p>\r\n<p>The scheme is expected to provide partial financial support to the faculty members who have received either no funds or partial funds for the proposed equipment. &ldquo;The scheme has been launched under the Institute of Eminence (IoE) scheme to enable young enthusiastic faculty members in medical, agricultural, environmental and earth sciences, to acquire equipment of their use which are not available in their respective departments or BHU,&rdquo; says DS Pandey, professor in-charge, Sponsored Research and Industrial Consultancy Cell, who is part of the scheme's four-member committee to review the proposals.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Meeting their needs</strong><br />&ldquo;The initiative will support the faculty with a fund of Rs 20 lakh (as a one-time measure), though in exceptional cases, recommendations might be made for financial support up to Rs 50 lakh, depending on the proposed and sanctioned amount,&rdquo; Pandey adds. The scheme will also provide reasonable funds to develop the infrastructure needed for research.</p>\r\n<p>Referring to the BHU initiative as &ldquo;intramural funding in which the university/department has a corpus of funds to support the research initiatives of its faculty and research scholars&rdquo;, Anuradha Majumdar, former dean, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Mumbai, says there is no dearth of funds for faculty to conduct their research, but they need to be able to write quality proposals to receive the government&rsquo;s approval.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Small steps</strong><br />&ldquo;The young faculty should start with small research grants and build their understanding of how to write a proper research proposal prior to taking the plunge with larger funding schemes,&rdquo; Majumdar says, elaborating that the quantum of research grants disbursed by the University of Mumbai as minor research project grants may be not high, but it provides seed grant to young faculty members across all streams that helps them in the pursuit of their PhDs too.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Government funding sources</strong><br />Faculty across all departments and colleges at Mumbai University are, however, free to apply to central government schemes. &ldquo;Earlier, the University Grants Commission (UGC) used to give both major and minor grants, and while the major grants no longer exist, there are various bodies such as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Department of Science &amp; Technology (DST) etc that are focused on green technology, fibres, nanotechnology, etc for which there are calls for proposals across the year. Moreover, there are several funding schemes under the DST and Department of Biotechnology (DBT) with its Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) in which faculty members can collaborate with industry for scaling up and commercialisation,&rdquo; Majumdar adds.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Upgrading obsolete equipment</strong><br />At IIT Roorkee, varied schemes have been developed to create an enabling culture for its faculty researchers. Its SMILE (Support for Major Interdisciplinary Laboratory Equipment) Scheme 2022 provides support for the procurement of major equipment in research areas where a long-felt need exists, or for supporting new thrust research areas. &ldquo;The significant facilities costing above Rs 25 lakh will be considered for support under this scheme. The initiative may also consider proposals for upgrading obsolete research equipment or any obsolete subsystem of any existing equipment,&rdquo; says Akshay Dvivedi, dean, Sponsored Research and Industrial Consultancy, IIT Roorkee where research is mainly supported by DST, DBT, MNRE, ICMR, DRDO, etc and various other government ministries.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Institute schemes</strong><br />Dvivedi further cites institute schemes such as the Faculty Initiation Grant (Fig), Matching Grant Scheme and Institute Research Fellowships (IRF) to promote research activities.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Faculty Initiation Grant (FIG) scheme supports newly joined faculty members to establish preliminary R&amp;D setups while the Matching Grant Scheme encourages the submission of more sponsored research proposals from the faculty members in addition to addressing some of the issues that arise when a sponsored research proposal is approved. A group of faculty members can apply for pooling of their Matching Grants to procure a high-cost equipment/facility. A Matching Grant can also be sought as a commitment letter from the institute at the time of submission/negotiation of a sponsored research proposal,&rdquo; Dvivedi adds.</p>\r\n<p>For young faculty members below the age of 40, there is an Institute Research Fellowship which recognises and rewards their outputs. Considering the facilitation measures, Dvivedi feels there are no instances where a faculty&rsquo;s research has been hampered due to a lack of finances and equipment.</p>",
