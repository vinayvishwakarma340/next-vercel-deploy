Cd Rise is a 4-week intensive corporate readiness program taught by experienced women leaders. Having worked with several interns over decades, we realize that though generation next is high on potential and competencies, they tend to miss making their mark in the organizations they&rsquo;ve interned with. This is so because of the lack of exposure to life skills along with several corporate efficiency traits that they are yet to discover. This program, therefore, connects the dots and caters to the need for a finishing school for young women getting ready to start their careers and hence blur gender gaps in their formative years at work itself.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>CORPORATE DIVA</strong>:&nbsp;<br />A 2-day self-development journey, on self-evaluation,&nbsp; activation, and calming of the inner critique for emerging women leaders to enable them to rise higher on their professional ladder, embrace leadership more effectively, and create impact. It aims at enhancing their strength, competence, intellect, and caliber which women most often underplay at work. Recently an extension of the program has pivoted online called CDx</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>CD PLUS</strong>:&nbsp;<br />An intense, 3-month step-up program for Senior women in leadership. To a large extent, these women have successfully shattered the glass ceiling, however, what lies ahead for them to encounter, might be the Glass Cliff. The CD PLUS Program is a deep dive into the key areas that more significantly contribute to gender inequality statistics. The program is a superb amalgamation of digital assessments,&nbsp; master classes brought forth by experts par excellence, along with interactions with mentors, intense coaching, and buddy support from the Corporate Diva Tribe. All in all CD PlUS+ is that one intense program that sets&nbsp; you up, above the rest&nbsp; for what it takes to show the mettle of a competent&nbsp; woman LEADER</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>REDISCOVER THE DIVA IN YOU:</strong>&nbsp;<br />A one-day activation session followed by a 2-month intense program for women returning back to work after sabbatical/layoff/ready to re-start. While the activation session gives them a flavor of how we can enable them to come up the curve, the 2-month Diva Re-start program is the compounding of knowledge, skills, best practices, clarity, direction, network, and coaching from highly acclaimed professionals. This program not only focuses on getting your mindset ready for re-start but also on getting you all set to shine bright to the best version of your employable self, and leverage every opportunity that comes your way.
